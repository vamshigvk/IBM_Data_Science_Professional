1. Scientific computing libraries:
	- Pandas : For data structures and tools 
	- Numpy  : For arrays and Matrices
	- Scipy  : For Integrals, solving differential equations, optimization

2. Visualization libraries:
	- Matplotlib : Plots and graphs, most popular
	- Seaborn    : Advanced plots like heat maps, time series, violin graphs

3. Algorithmic libraries:
	- Scikit-learn : tools statistical modeling for Machine learning including regression,classification, clustering and etc.
			(This library is built on Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib) 
	- Statsmodels  : Explore data, estimate statistical models and perform statistical tests.

Pandas methods:

import pandas as pd
df=pd.read_csv(url)

df.dtypes # to get datatype of each column
df.describe() # to get a statistical summary of each column like mean , median etc and to find outliers
df.describt(include="all") # to summarize integer columns and object typed columns as well (string columns)
df.info() # to get top 30 and bottom 30 rows only
